title: Learning optimization algorithms with neural networks

event: MSc in Data Science pre-graduation theses presentations

location: Athens University of Economics & Business

summary: A presentation of my MSc thesis on meta-learning, awarded with the "EFG Eurobank scholarship" for the best thesis in my class.
abstract: "I gave a presentation of my MSc thesis, entitled Learning optimization algorithms with neural networks to both my class' students and a three-professor review commitee. This thesis drew inspiration from then recent work on meta-learning or learning to learn by Nando de Freitas and his team"
