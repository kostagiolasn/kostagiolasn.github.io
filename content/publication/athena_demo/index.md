abstract: In this demonstration, we present LGM-PC, a QGIS plugin for automatic recommendation
  of categories for new POIs. LGM-PC allows users to train classification models on
  individual areas of POIs and, then, use these models in order to classify new POIs
  into categories. The tool produces ranked category recommendations, based solely
  on the name of the POI, its coordinates and properties of its surrounding POIs,
  which are already annotated with categories. The user is then required to validate
  the produced recommendations, by selecting the most fitting category. Being implemented
  as a QGIS plugin, LGM-PC allows the visualization of POIs on map layers, for further
  assisting the user in the final category selection task.
