Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the CaSToRC unit of the Cyprus Institute under the supervision of Prof. Mihalis Nicolaou, focusing on Representation Learning and Computer Vision.

Earlier on and for the period of 9 months I was a research assistant at the [DMML Group](http://dmml.ch/) of the University of Geneva under the supervision of Prof. Alexandros Kalousis focusing on applying Reinforcement Learning / Imitation Learning techniques to human locomotion modeling.

Before that, I was a Machine Learning Engineer / Research Assistant at the [“Athena” Center for Research and Innovation](https://www.athena-innovation.gr/en/home) working on developing machine learning techniques for geospatial data analysis.

I’ve completed my M.Sc. degree in Data Science at the [Computer Science department](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/c) of the Athens University of Economics and Business and my B.Sc. degree in Informatics and Telecommunications at National & Kapodistrian University of Athens. My M.Sc. thesis, entitled “learning optimization algorithms with neural networks” received the “EFG Eurobank” scholarship award for the best thesis of the program. In this thesis I examined the generalization capabilities of meta-learning or “learned” optimization algorithms under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Evangelos Markakis](http://pages.cs.aueb.gr/~markakis/). You can access my M.Sc. thesis [here](paper/msc-thesis.pdf).

In the past, I have also conducted research under the supervision of Dr. Evangelia Zacharaki of the [Multidimensional Data Analysis and Knowledge Management Laboratory](http://mdakm.ceid.upatras.gr/index.php/en/home/) at the University of Patras. I have also conducted research under the supervision of [Dr. Theodoros Giannakopoulos](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~tyianak/) at the [CIL Lab](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/cil/) and [Dr. George Giannakopoulos](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~ggianna/) at the [SKEL Lab](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/skel) of the National Center for Scientific Research, Demokritos. For more information on current and past research, please check the publications and projects pages.

During my years as a B.Sc. student, I had interned at IBM Hellas S.A. working in Data Warehousing and Data Mining. I have also been a part of the PreVo Windows Phone developing team that won the 1st European Position at the Night of the Living Devs hackathon, organized by Microsoft Co.
