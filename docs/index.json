Of course, we need it. Instead, the question is: how attractive and elegant is the website? Being a Ph.D. student, it\u0026rsquo;s not a surprise that I find an academic-theme website very attractive. Developing such a website from the scratch needs huge time and effort. Luckily, there are open source templates such as Hugo templates. Recently I created my website using such a template. Below is a blurred screenshot of the site.\nWhat I like about the website are:\nIt is simple in design, attractive in appearance, and elegant in presentation. Easy to customize if you know R. HTML, JavaScript, or CSS knowledge is NOT necessary. The code is maintained as a repository in Github. As a result, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to edit or update the site. The site has been deployed in Github, no need to buy a domain name. It is also easy to deploy the site in a custom domain name. It offers a simple and powerful personal blogging feature. Seamlessly rendered in computers, cell-phones, iPads, and other devices. Though the Hugo academic template was fairly simple, first I had to figure out how to use it and then how to customize it. I started by looking into the blog posts by Alison Hill, Leslie Myint, and Ming Tang. While each of these blogs was helpful, the actual development was slightly different because things have changed since their publications. Here I share how I used and personalized the template.\nI divide the website development into four steps.\nRequirement gathering Just running a template site Personalizing the site Hosting and deployment Step-1: Requirement gathering I have R and RStudio installed on my computer. Working knowledge of R coding is necessary. Installed blogdown package in R. The book blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown is a good resource to know the basics related to this website development. Installed GO language on the computer. I have a Github account. Working knowledge of Github is necessary. Step-2: Just running a template site I forked the starter-academic repository on my Github account. Alternatively, one can create a repository using starter-academic as a template.\nRenamed the repository to alorchhota.github.io from Settings. Please note the name format here: [myaccountid].github.io. This name format would be useful later to deploy the website. Here is my repository \u0026ndash; you may take a look if you like.\nCloned the repository on my local computer using Terminal.\ngit clone https://github.com/alorchhota/alorchhota.github.io # remember to use your repository Opened the repository in RStudio as a new package (from an existing directory). There I loaded the blogdown package and installed Hugo.\nlibrary(blogdown) blogdown::install_hugo() Restarted RStudio \u0026ndash; required for loading the updated $PATH variable.\nIn Rstudio, I built the template website, and start the server.\nlibrary(blogdown) build_site() # hugo: downloading modules â€¦ # hugo: collected modules in 15019 ms # Start building sites â€¦ # # | EN # -------------------+----- # Pages | 52 # Paginator pages | 0 # Non-page files | 7 # Static files | 3 # Processed images | 39 # Aliases | 12 # Sitemaps | 1 # Cleaned | 0 # # Total in 26388 ms serve_site() # Launching the server via the command: # C:/Users/Shatil/AppData/Roaming/Hugo/0.80.0/hugo.exe server --bind 127.0.0.1 -p 4321 --themesDir themes -D -F --navigateToChanged # Serving the directory . at http://localhost:4321 # Launched the hugo server in the background (process ID: 9296). To stop it, call blogdown::stop_server() or restart the R session. At this point, the template website was visible in the RStudio Viewer panel (see the image below). When I clicked on the button as marked by a red circle, the website opened in a web browser. Generally, the website updated updated each time I saved any change. Occasionally, I needed to stop the site by calling stop_server(), and then restart by calling build_site() and serve_site() manually.\nStep-3: Personalizing the site The variables in the template repository are pretty self-explanatory and need no explanation. So, instead of describing every variable change, here I mention only the notable changes. You are welcome to visit my repository to see all changes.\nUpdated the title and copyright in the file: config/_default/config.toml keeping everything else unchanged.\n# Title of your site title = \u0026quot;Ashis Saha\u0026quot; # The URL of your site. # End your URL with a `/` trailing slash, e.g. `https://example.com/`. baseurl = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; # Enter a copyright notice to display in the site footer. # To display a copyright symbol, type `\u0026amp;copy;`.

Most network analyses to date have been limited to assessing correlation between total gene expression levels in a single tissue or small sets of tissues. Here, we built networks that additionally capture the regulation of relative isoform abundance and splicing, along with tissue-specific connections unique to each of a diverse set of tissues. We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6 RNA sequencing data across 50 tissues and 449 individuals. First, we developed a framework called Transcriptome-Wide Networks (TWNs) for combining total expression and relative isoform levels into a single sparse network, capturing the interplay between the regulation of splicing and transcription. We built TWNs for 16 tissues and found that hubs in these networks were strongly enriched for splicing and RNA binding genes, demonstrating their utility in unraveling regulation of splicing in the human transcriptome. Next, we used a Bayesian biclustering model that identifies network edges unique to a single tissue to reconstruct Tissue-Specific Networks (TSNs) for 26 distinct tissues and 10 groups of related tissues. Finally, we found genetic variants associated with pairs of adjacent nodes in our networks, supporting the estimated network structures and identifying 20 genetic variants with distant regulatory impact on transcription and splicing. Our networks provide an improved understanding of the complex relationships of the human transcriptome across tissues. # # Summary.

Most existing approaches make the assumption that the handled POIs carry a wealth of metadata (e.g. reviews, ratings, working hours, price ranges). Consequently, such methods rely on semantically rich POI profiles and exploit them to develop correspondingly rich, and thus more accurate, POI classification models. However, in several real world scenarios, assuming the existence of such rich POI profiles is unrealistic. Contrary to existing works, we propose a method that can produce accurate category recommendations based only on the minimum amount of initially available POI metadata (name, coordinates) combined with open and straightforwardly accessible metadata drawn from OpenStreetMap. To this end, we propose a set of textual and neighbourhood-based training features, capturing POI properties as well as their relations with their spatial neighborhoods. These features are fed into several classification algorithms and are evaluated on a proprietary POI dataset of a geo-marketing company and the Yelp POI dataset.","tags":["machine learning","classification","feature extraction","POI"],"title":"Classifying Points of Interest with Minimum Metadata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgos Eftaxias","Nontas Tsakonas","Giorgos Giannopoulos","Nikos Kostagiolas","Andreas Syngros","Dimitrios Skoutas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658832764,"objectID":"37e54829271b3cea46ebbb90d92932c5","permalink":"/publication/athena_demo/","publishdate":"2022-07-26T10:52:43.678915Z","relpermalink":"/publication/athena_demo/","section":"publication","summary":"In this demonstration, we present LGM-PC, a QGIS plugin for automatic recommendation of categories for new POIs. LGM-PC allows users to train classification models on individual areas of POIs and, then, use these models in order to classify new POIs into categories. The tool produces ranked category recommendations, based solely on the name of the POI, its coordinates and properties of its surrounding POIs, which are already annotated with categories. The user is then required to validate the produced recommendations, by selecting the most fitting category. Being implemented as a QGIS plugin, LGM-PC allows the visualization of POIs on map layers, for further assisting the user in the final category selection task.","tags":["Classification","Feature Extraction","Spatial","Categorization","POI","ML"],"title":"LGM-PC: A Tool for POI Classification on QGIS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikos Kostagiolas","Nikiforos Pittaras","Christoforos Nikolaou","George Giannakopoulos"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658832465,"objectID":"70cb0c2de9d1064697fc18e2beeb2234","permalink":"/publication/nucleosomes/","publishdate":"2022-07-26T10:52:44.078939Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nucleosomes/","section":"publication","summary":"Motivation Nucleosomes form the first level of DNA compaction and thus bear a critical role in the overall genome organization. At the same time, they modulate chromatin accessibility and, through a dynamic equilibrium with other DNA-binding proteins, may shape gene expression. A number of large-scale nucleosome positioning maps, obtained for various genomes, has compelled the importance of nucleosomes in the regulation of gene expression and has shown constraints in the relative positions of nucleosomes to be much stronger around regulatory elements (i.e. promoters, splice junctions and enhancers). At the same time, the great majority of nucleosome positions appears to be rather flexible. Various computational methods have in the past been used in order to capture the sequence determinants of nucleosome positioning but, as the extent to which DNA sequence preferences may guide nucleosome occupancy largely varies, this has proved to be rather difficult. In order to focus on highly specific sequence attributes, in this work we have analyzed two well-defined sets of nucleosome-occupied sites (NOS) and nucleosome-free-regions (NFR) from the genome of S. cerevisiae, with the use of textual representations.Results We employed 3 different genomic sequence representations (Hidden Markov Models, Bag-of-Words and N-gram Graphs) combined with a number of machine learning algorithms on the task of classifying genomic sequences as nucleosome-free (NFR) or nucleosome-occupied NOS (to be further amended based on updated results). We found that different approaches that involve the usage of different representations or algorithms can be more or less effective at predicting nucleosome positioning based on the textual data of the underlying genomic sequence. More interestingly, we show that N-gram Graphs, a sequence representation that takes into account both k-mer occurrences and relative positioning at various lengths scales is outperforming other methodologies and may thus be a choice of preference for the analysis of DNA sequences with subtle constraints.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring different sequence representations and classification methods for the prediction of nucleosome positioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
