Despite these improvements, the adoption of such approaches in the domain of satellite imagery is not straightforward. Typical vision datasets used in generative tasks are well-aligned and annotated, and exhibit limited variability. In contrast, satellite imagery exhibits great spatial and spectral variability, wide presence of fine, high-frequency details, while the tedious nature of annotating satellite imagery leads to annotation scarcity - further motivating developments in unsupervised learning. In this light, we present the first pre-trained style- and wavelet-based GAN model that can readily synthesize a wide gamut of realistic satellite images in a variety of settings and conditions - while also preserving high-frequency information. Furthermore, we show that by analyzing the intermediate activations of our network, one can discover a multitude of interpretable semantic directions that facilitate the guided synthesis of satellite images in terms of high-level concepts (e.g., urbanization) without using any form of supervision. Via a set of qualitative and quantitative experiments we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, in terms of suitability for downstream tasks (e.g., data augmentation), quality of synthetic imagery, as well as generalization capabilities to unseen datasets.","tags":[],"title":"Unsupervised Discovery of Semantic Concepts in Satellite Imagery with Style-based Wavelet-driven Generative Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne **Two** Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

Most existing approaches make the assumption that the handled POIs carry a wealth of metadata (e.g. reviews, ratings, working hours, price ranges). Consequently, such methods rely on semantically rich POI profiles and exploit them to develop correspondingly rich, and thus more accurate, POI classification models. However, in several real world scenarios, assuming the existence of such rich POI profiles is unrealistic. Contrary to existing works, we propose a method that can produce accurate category recommendations based only on the minimum amount of initially available POI metadata (name, coordinates) combined with open and straightforwardly accessible metadata drawn from OpenStreetMap. To this end, we propose a set of textual and neighbourhood-based training features, capturing POI properties as well as their relations with their spatial neighborhoods. These features are fed into several classification algorithms and are evaluated on a proprietary POI dataset of a geo-marketing company and the Yelp POI dataset.","tags":["machine learning","classification","feature extraction","POI"],"title":"Classifying Points of Interest with Minimum Metadata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgos Eftaxias","Nontas Tsakonas","Giorgos Giannopoulos","Nikos Kostagiolas","Andreas Syngros","Dimitrios Skoutas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658832764,"objectID":"37e54829271b3cea46ebbb90d92932c5","permalink":"/publication/athena_demo/","publishdate":"2022-07-26T10:52:43.678915Z","relpermalink":"/publication/athena_demo/","section":"publication","summary":"In this demonstration, we present LGM-PC, a QGIS plugin for automatic recommendation of categories for new POIs.

The user is then required to validate the produced recommendations, by selecting the most fitting category.

At the same time, they modulate chromatin accessibility and, through a dynamic equilibrium with other DNA-binding proteins, may shape gene expression. A number of large-scale nucleosome positioning maps, obtained for various genomes, has compelled the importance of nucleosomes in the regulation of gene expression and has shown constraints in the relative positions of nucleosomes to be much stronger around regulatory elements (i.e. promoters, splice junctions and enhancers). At the same time, the great majority of nucleosome positions appears to be rather flexible. Various computational methods have in the past been used in order to capture the sequence determinants of nucleosome positioning but, as the extent to which DNA sequence preferences may guide nucleosome occupancy largely varies, this has proved to be rather difficult. In order to focus on highly specific sequence attributes, in this work we have analyzed two well-defined sets of nucleosome-occupied sites (NOS) and nucleosome-free-regions (NFR) from the genome of S. cerevisiae, with the use of textual representations.Results We employed 3 different genomic sequence representations (Hidden Markov Models, Bag-of-Words and N-gram Graphs) combined with a number of machine learning algorithms on the task of classifying genomic sequences as nucleosome-free (NFR) or nucleosome-occupied NOS (to be further amended based on updated results). We found that different approaches that involve the usage of different representations or algorithms can be more or less effective at predicting nucleosome positioning based on the textual data of the underlying genomic sequence. More interestingly, we show that N-gram Graphs, a sequence representation that takes into account both k-mer occurrences and relative positioning at various lengths scales is outperforming other methodologies and may thus be a choice of preference for the analysis of DNA sequences with subtle constraints.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring different sequence representations and classification methods for the prediction of nucleosome positioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"/project/example/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"Project page of our SETN 2022 paper.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Unsupervised Discovery of Semantic Concepts in Satellite Imagery with Style-based Wavelet-driven Generative Models","type":"project"}]
