Most existing approaches make the assumption that the handled POIs carry a wealth of metadata (e.g. reviews, ratings, working hours, price ranges). Consequently, such methods rely on semantically rich POI profiles and exploit them to develop correspondingly rich, and thus more accurate, POI classification models. However, in several real world scenarios, assuming the existence of such rich POI profiles is unrealistic. Contrary to existing works, we propose a method that can produce accurate category recommendations based only on the minimum amount of initially available POI metadata (name, coordinates) combined with open and straightforwardly accessible metadata drawn from OpenStreetMap. To this end, we propose a set of textual and neighbourhood-based training features, capturing POI properties as well as their relations with their spatial neighborhoods. These features are fed into several classification algorithms and are evaluated on a proprietary POI dataset of a geo-marketing company and the Yelp POI dataset.","tags":["machine learning","classification","feature extraction","POI"],"title":"Classifying Points of Interest with Minimum Metadata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgos Eftaxias","Nontas Tsakonas","Giorgos Giannopoulos","Nikos Kostagiolas","Andreas Syngros","Dimitrios Skoutas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658832764,"objectID":"37e54829271b3cea46ebbb90d92932c5","permalink":"/publication/athena_demo/","publishdate":"2022-07-26T10:52:43.678915Z","relpermalink":"/publication/athena_demo/","section":"publication","summary":"In this demonstration, we present LGM-PC, a QGIS plugin for automatic recommendation of categories for new POIs.

At the same time, they modulate chromatin accessibility and, through a dynamic equilibrium with other DNA-binding proteins, may shape gene expression. A number of large-scale nucleosome positioning maps, obtained for various genomes, has compelled the importance of nucleosomes in the regulation of gene expression and has shown constraints in the relative positions of nucleosomes to be much stronger around regulatory elements (i.e. promoters, splice junctions and enhancers). At the same time, the great majority of nucleosome positions appears to be rather flexible. Various computational methods have in the past been used in order to capture the sequence determinants of nucleosome positioning but, as the extent to which DNA sequence preferences may guide nucleosome occupancy largely varies, this has proved to be rather difficult. In order to focus on highly specific sequence attributes, in this work we have analyzed two well-defined sets of nucleosome-occupied sites (NOS) and nucleosome-free-regions (NFR) from the genome of S. cerevisiae, with the use of textual representations.Results We employed 3 different genomic sequence representations (Hidden Markov Models, Bag-of-Words and N-gram Graphs) combined with a number of machine learning algorithms on the task of classifying genomic sequences as nucleosome-free (NFR) or nucleosome-occupied NOS (to be further amended based on updated results). We found that different approaches that involve the usage of different representations or algorithms can be more or less effective at predicting nucleosome positioning based on the textual data of the underlying genomic sequence. More interestingly, we show that N-gram Graphs, a sequence representation that takes into account both k-mer occurrences and relative positioning at various lengths scales is outperforming other methodologies and may thus be a choice of preference for the analysis of DNA sequences with subtle constraints.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring different sequence representations and classification methods for the prediction of nucleosome positioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Tensor Component Analysis for Interpreting the Latent Space of GANs Tensor Component Analysis for Interpreting the Latent Space of GANs James Oldfield1, Markos Georgopoulos2, Yannis Panagakis3, Mihalis A Nicolaou4, Ioannis Patras1\n1Queen Mary University of London, 2Imperial College London, 3University of Athens, 4The Cyprus Institute\nPaper Code\nAbstract This work addresses the problem of finding interpretable directions in the latent space of pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to facilitate controllable image synthesis. Such interpretable directions correspond to transformations that can affect both the style and geometry of the synthetic images. However, existing approaches that utilise linear techniques to find these transformations often fail to provide an intuitive way to separate these two sources of variation. To address this, we propose to a) perform a multilinear decomposition of the tensor of intermediate representations, and b) use a tensor-based regression to map directions found using this decomposition to the latent space. Our scheme allows for both linear edits corresponding to the individual modes of the tensor, and non-linear ones that model the multiplicative interactions between them. We show experimentally that we can utilise the former to better separate style- from geometry-based transformations, and the latter to generate an extended set of possible transformations in comparison to prior works.\nResults Experimental results making edits along each mode of the tensor separately, or via our \u0026ldquo;multilinear mixing\u0026rdquo; higher-order terms.\nMultilinear mixing Face thickness\nForehead thickness\nFace skew\nMode-wise edits Hair colour\nPitch\nYaw\nBibTeX If you find our work useful, please consider citing us:\n`@InProceedings{oldfield2021tca, author = {Oldfield, James and Markos, Georgopoulos and Panagakis, Yannis and Nicolaou, Mihalis A. and Ioannis, Patras}, title = {Tensor Component Analysis for Interpreting the Latent Space of GANs}, booktitle = {BMVC}, month = {November}, year = {2021} }` Related work Shen et al.
