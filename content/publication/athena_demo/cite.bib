 abstract = {In this demonstration, we present LGM-PC, a QGIS plugin for automatic recommendation of categories for new POIs. LGM-PC allows users to train classification models on individual areas of POIs and, then, use these models in order to classify new POIs into categories. The tool produces ranked category recommendations, based solely on the name of the POI, its coordinates and properties of its surrounding POIs, which are already annotated with categories. The user is then required to validate the produced recommendations, by selecting the most fitting category. Being implemented as a QGIS plugin, LGM-PC allows the visualization of POIs on map layers, for further assisting the user in the final category selection task.},
